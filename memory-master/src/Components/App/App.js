/* Plan for MVP
- The user will be presented with a form in which they select from a list of hard-coded subjects, in which the subsequent flash cards will be grouped.
- To add a new flash card to the group/topic they enter a question and an answer and click submit, at which point they will be prompted, "Card successfully added to ${subject}. Click on the subject to test yourself on it!"
- When the user has finished and clicked submit, the app will display the group of cards in a list. The user can then open the group by clicking on it. At which point, the first question will display.
- When the user has answered the Q in their heads, they click the "flip" button, which will reveal the answer.
- They then honestly log if they got the question right (2 points), wrong (0 points), or partly right (1 point).
